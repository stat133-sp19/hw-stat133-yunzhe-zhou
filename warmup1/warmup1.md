Cooking Recipe
==============

### Broccoli Melts

##### Ingredients

-   1 pound broccolini or regular broccoli
-   2 tablespoons olive oil
-   3 cloves garlic, minced
-   A few pinches red pepper flakes, to taste
-   Finely grated zest, then juice, of 1/2 lemon
-   Coarse salt, to taste
-   1/2 cup finely grated aged pecorino romano cheese
-   8 thin slices totally unfancy deli provolone
-   8 slices bread of your choice

##### "Special" Kitchen Tools

-   paper towels
-   vegetable peeler
-   oven

##### Recipes Step

1.  Cutting the broccolini into 2-inch segments.

2.  Pour about 1-inch puddle of salted water into a large sauté pan and bring to a boil. Add broccoli and cover with a lid and boil/steam for 2 minutes. Drain well and pat dry on paper towels, wringing out as much extra liquid as possible. Chop into small (roughly 1/2-inch) bits.

3.  Wipe sauté pan dry and heat over medium. Add olive oil and let it heat for a full minute. Add garlic and pepper flakes, cooking for 1 minutes, or until the garlic is just beginning to turn golden. Add the broccoli and cook 1 to 2 minutes more, seasoning with salt. Transfer mixture to a bowl and add lemon zest, juice, pecorino and more salt and pepper flakes to taste.

4.  Heat broiler. Arrange slices of bread on a tray and lightly toast on both sides. Scoop broccoli mixture onto each slice of bread, lay a slice of provolone over it and run under the broiler until cheese has melted and begun to blister. Eat. Repeat. Don’t forget to share, or at least hide the evidence if you decide not to.

##### Special Seasons

The food is actually suitable for very seasons in a year.

##### Variations of the Recipe

If we use the regular broccoli in the place of the broccolini, peel the stems with a vegetable peeler first so that they cook evenly, and cut the rest into large chunks.

Euclidean Distance
==================

<font size=4> **Definition** </font> \[edit\]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $\\mathbf{(\\overline{pq})}$.

In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates), if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem):

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The [**Euclidean norm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
