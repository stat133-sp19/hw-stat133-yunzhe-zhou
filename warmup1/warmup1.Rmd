#Cooking Recipe

###Broccoli Melts

#####Ingredients

* 1 pound broccolini or regular broccoli
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* A few pinches red pepper flakes, to taste
* Finely grated zest, then juice, of 1/2 lemon
* Coarse salt, to taste
* 1/2 cup finely grated aged pecorino romano cheese
* 8 thin slices totally unfancy deli provolone
* 8 slices bread of your choice

#####"Special" Kitchen Tools

- paper towels
- vegetable peeler
- oven

#####Recipes Step

1. Cutting the broccolini into 2-inch segments.

2. Pour about 1-inch puddle of salted water into a large saut¨¦ pan and bring to a boil. Add broccoli and cover with a lid and boil/steam for 2 minutes. Drain well and pat dry on paper towels, wringing out as much extra liquid as possible. Chop into small (roughly 1/2-inch) bits.

3. Wipe saut¨¦ pan dry and heat over medium. Add olive oil and let it heat for a full minute. Add garlic and pepper flakes, cooking for 1 minutes, or until the garlic is just beginning to turn golden. Add the broccoli and cook 1 to 2 minutes more, seasoning with salt. Transfer mixture to a bowl and add lemon zest, juice, pecorino and more salt and pepper flakes to taste.

4. Heat broiler. Arrange slices of bread on a tray and lightly toast on both sides. Scoop broccoli mixture onto each slice of bread, lay a slice of provolone over it and run under the broiler until cheese has melted and begun to blister. Eat. Repeat. Don¡¯t forget to share, or at least hide the evidence if you decide not to.

#####Special Seasons

The food is actually suitable for very seasons in a year.

#####Variations of the Recipe

 If we use the regular broccoli in the place of the broccolini, peel the stems with a vegetable peeler first so that they cook evenly, and cut the rest into large chunks.

#Euclidean Distance

<font size=4> **Definition** </font>  [edit] \
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \
The **Euclidean distance** between points $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ is the length of the line segment connecting them $\mathbf{(\overline{pq})}$.

In [Cartesian coordinates][1], if $\mathbf{p}=(p_1,p_2,...,p_n)$ and $\mathbf{q}=(q_1,q_2,...,q_n)$ are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from $\mathbf{p}$ to $\mathbf{q}$, or from $\mathbf{q}$ to $\mathbf{p}$ is given by the [Pythagorean formula][2]:

\begin{equation} 
\begin{split} 
d(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}) = d(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p})
&=\sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2+(q_2-p_2)^2+...+(q_n-p_n)^2} \\
&=\sqrt{\sum^{n}_{i=1}(q_i-p_i)^2}.                                     
\end{split} \tag{1}
\end{equation}

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a [Euclidean vector][3]. So, $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The [**Euclidean norm**][4], or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

\begin{equation*}
||\mathbf{p}||=\sqrt{p_1^2+p_2^2+...+p_n^2}=\sqrt{\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{p}} ,
\end{equation*}

where the last expression involves the [dot product][5].
